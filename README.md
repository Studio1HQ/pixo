# Pixo

Pixo is a simple image editor built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It allows you to upload an image, apply filters, and download the edited image.

This is the first version of pixo that used Webcrumbs Frontend AI to generate the UI and Github Copilot to generate the code. There is a lot of room for improvement and It would be great to have your feedback, suggestions, and contributions.
